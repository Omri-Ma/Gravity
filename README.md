# Gravitational Slingshot Effect

A Python project using Pygame to simulate a gravitational slingshot effect in space.


## Description

This project utilizes the Pygame library to create a simulation of a spacecraft experiencing 
gravitational forces around a central planet. The goal is to showcase the application of physics 
concepts in a visually interactive manner.

## Features

- Gravitational slingshot effect simulation.
- User-controllable spacecraft creation using mouse input.
- Elastic collisions between the spacecraft and the central planet.
- Real-time scoring based on spacecraft achievements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Omri-Ma/gravity-slingshot.git
  
2. Install Pygame:
     pip install pygame

3. Run the main script:
     python main.py

## Usage

- Launch the simulation and observe the spacecraft's movement influenced by gravitational forces.
- Click to create a spacecraft, click again to set its initial velocity vector.

- Here is an example:
